","category":"page"},{"location":"future_plans/","page":"Future plans","title":"Future plans","text":"The first point is difficult to fix without using polygons for districts and countries. The second point could be easily fixed by using a haversine formula (probably an overkill) or simply compensating for the different lat/lon degree length (WE degrees have different length at different lattitudes) with simple cosine formula. To implement this, I would like to gather a test dataset first to determine whether the more complex calculation is worth the effort. Some reported inaccuracies can be found here.","category":"page"},{"location":"future_plans/#Change-installation-and-usage","page":"Future plans","title":"Change installation and usage","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"future_plans/","page":"Future plans","title":"Future plans","text":"Right now, the database of reference points is downloaded upon first use of Geocoder.
